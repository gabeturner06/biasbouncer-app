# BiasBouncer

BiasBouncer is a powerful tool designed to detect, analyze, and mitigate biases in AI models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). Built with cutting-edge technology like LangChain, Streamlit, and OpenAI, it helps users identify biases in AI outputs and provides solutions for fairer, more inclusive models.

🚀 Features

Bias Detection: Leverages machine learning and NLP techniques to detect biases in AI-generated content.
Customizable: Easily integrate your own datasets and AI models for tailored bias analysis.
Interactive Interface: Built using Streamlit for a sleek, easy-to-use web interface.
Real-time Analysis: Instantly evaluate model outputs for signs of bias with comprehensive visual feedback.
Open Source: Open and transparent design to encourage community collaboration and improvement.
🛠️ Technologies Used

LangChain: For building powerful pipelines and workflows with LLMs.
Streamlit: For creating an intuitive, interactive frontend.
OpenAI API: To utilize GPT-3 for analysis and generation.
Chroma: A vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.
Python: The core language for the application.
Docker: For containerized deployment.
GitHub Actions: For CI/CD workflows.
