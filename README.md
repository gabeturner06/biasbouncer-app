# BiasBouncer

**BiasBouncer** is a tool for creative thinkers and problem solvers that creates personal, diversified AI agents that help you to brainstorm ideas and bring them to life on a single platform.


## 🚀 **How it Works**

Every idea begins to take shape with a Brainstorming session. Ask a question or pitch your idea to BiasBouncer in the Brainstorm Chat. From there, BiasBouncer will explore the different perspectives needed to accurately address the complications of your idea. Each agent will respond to you casually, outlining their informed thoughts or spitballing new ideas. Keep brainstorming with your team the same way you would with your friends or work partners. When you have a plan put together, you can begin orchestrating your work.

BiasBouncer will instruct agents to simultaneously perform different tasks like research, coding, reviewing, and more. Those tasks will populate in the "To Do" column and gradually move to the right, so you can monitor their progress and review the task details. You can always chat with the agents if they have questions about their work or you want to add feedback. Once all the tasks have ended up in the "Done" column, your finished project will be ready to download!
